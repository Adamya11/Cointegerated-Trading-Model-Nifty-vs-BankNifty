# Trading Models Nifty with Technical Indicators

As of 2021, there are 20 Million traders in India who trade actively on Nifty and Bank Nifty Index. Though this number is very small when compared to the population of India but the number of people opening trading accounts every month is on a all time high and this number is expected to increase rapidly over the next coming years as India is on a high growth trajectory.

Every trader has it's own principles, targets, stop losses and indicators to buy and sell stocks. Majority of the people let their emotions make trade for them. But there are still traders who are strict with their trading rules and they buy/sell strictly according to those indicators. You might have read about RSI index (when the stocks are over bought and over sold) , MACD Crossover indicators, Moving Averages and others. But do we know which indicators have given the best returns over the last 10 years? Are you confident about which indicator to stick with? Are there any combination of indicators which can give even better returns than the tried and test RSI and MACD? Which indicators worked well during the pandemic? Well, these are the questions i'll try to solve in this project.

The motive of this project is to make my own customized models based on historical data from which I can initiate trades with more confidence and informed decisions. Obviously there will be exceptions like the covid pandemic which led to market crumbling down to multiple years low and then making a new all time high in the same year. 

Let's jump right into the project and try to find answers to all the above questions!!
